# Website for OpenSeadragon

This repository is a Github Organization Page; everything that's checked in to the master branch is automatically published to http://openseadragon.github.com/. 

The files that are checked in here (with the exception of this readme) are all generated from the site-build repository.

The website also makes use of the example-images repository, which is a Github Project Page, published automatically to http://openseadragon.github.com/example-images. If you want to test the site locally, you'll need to include that repository as example-images inside your openseadragon.github.com folder. This repository's .gitignore excludes that folder, so you can leave it there without accidentally checking it in.
